_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is asking me to format a Markdown document to make it clearer and more instructive for Claude code to use as guidelines. Based on the content provided, this appears to be a document outlining best practices for working with Claude as an AI assistant for coding tasks.

Let me analyze what needs to be improved in the current formatting:

1. The document already has section headings but could benefit from clearer hierarchy and better visual organization
2. It contains lists that could be better formatted with proper Markdown bullet points
3. The document has some visual elements (like colored boxes in the image) that aren't represented in the Markdown
4. The document contains action buttons/examples that could be formatted better

I'll reformat this document to:
1. Use proper Markdown heading levels (# for main headings, ## for subheadings)
2. Format lists properly with bullet points
3. Use blockquotes or code blocks for examples
4. Add emphasis (bold/italic) where appropriate
5. Create clearer visual separation between sections
6. Make command examples stand out better
7. Maintain all the original content while improving readability

The goal is to create a well-structured Markdown document that serves as clear guidelines for working with Claude for coding tasks.</think># Claude Code Guidelines

## Project Initialization
When starting a new project, always use the `/init` command. This command creates a "Claude.md" document containing your project documentation for easy reference.

## Working Effectively
After initializing your project, always ask Claude Code to explain the project thoroughly. Request details about each component, their functionalities, and how they interconnect with other parts of your project.

### For Complex Changes
If you're planning a major change, such as large-scale refactoring or adding complex new functionality, always instruct Claude Code to outline a plan before implementing any changes. Encourage deeper thinking by using phrases such as:

> **Think hard**  
> **Think deep**  
> **Think longer**

After reviewing Claude's proposed plan, if you agree, proceed directly with the changes. If not, request revisions to the plan.

### For Simple Changes
For smaller changes, such as simple, single-file updates or straightforward features, clearly specify the exact file you want to modify. For example:

```
Claude, can you increase the size of the chat input in the file "user/page.tsx"?
```

```
Claude, can you add error handling to "data_processing.py"?
```

```
Claude, please refactor the 'calculate_totals' function in "invoice.py"
```

## Other Best Practices

* Regularly use the `/compact` command during development. This helps Claude Code remain efficient and reduces the risk of confusion in long-term projects.

* Always be explicit about which files you intend to change and clearly state their relationships to other components.

* Frequently run tests. Claude Code excels at validating new functionality through thorough testing, ensuring reliability and accuracy.

* Periodically ask Claude Code to review the entire project, assessing logic consistency and identifying any redundant or inefficient code.
