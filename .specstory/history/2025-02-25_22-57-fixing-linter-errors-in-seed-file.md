# Fixing Linter Errors in Seed File (2025-02-25 16:57:13)

Fix this file errors

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>Looking at the linter errors, there's a recurring issue with the `address` property in the restaurants data. The errors suggest that there's a syntax error - the colon (`:`) is missing between `address` and the URL string. This is happening for every restaurant object in the array.

Instead of:
```typescript
address"https://experiencemaplegrove.com/dine-location/the-great-greek-mediterranean-grill/",
```

It should be:
```typescript
address: "https://experiencemaplegrove.com/dine-location/the-great-greek-mediterranean-grill/",
```

The fix is straightforward: I need to add a colon after `address` for each restaurant object. This will properly define the address property with its value.</think>I'll fix the linter errors in the seed.ts file. The main issue is that all of the `address` properties in the restaurant objects are missing a colon (`:`) between the property name and value.

I fixed the syntax errors in the seed.ts file by adding colons after each `address` property. 

The issue was that all the restaurant objects in the array were missing the colon symbol between the property name `address` and its value. This caused the TypeScript compiler to interpret the code incorrectly, leading to the various errors you were seeing.

Now each restaurant object correctly formats the address property like:
```typescript
address: "https://experiencemaplegrove.com/dine-location/example/",
```

This should resolve all the linter errors and allow the seed script to run properly.
