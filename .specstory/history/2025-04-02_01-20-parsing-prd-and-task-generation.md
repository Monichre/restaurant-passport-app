_**User**_

Can you parse the PRD file and generate tasks

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll follow these steps to fulfill your request:

1. Create a PRD file (named “PRD.txt”) containing the full Product Requirements Document. This file holds the PRD content (overview, technical stack, user flows, database schema, etc.) that you provided.  
2. Write a pseudocode file ("ParsePrdAndGenerateTasks_PSEUDOCODE.md") that outlines the steps to parse the PRD and generate tasks.  
3. Document our approach and details in a documentation file ("ParsePrdAndGenerateTasks.md").  
4. Finally, run the command to parse the PRD and generate tasks using our task-master CLI command.

I’ll now create these files and then run the parse command.
