# Fixing useUser Hook in Next.js (2025-02-25 14:49:33)

_**User**_

[ Server ] Error: Attempted to call useUser() from the server but useUser is on the client. It's not possible to invoke a client function from the server, it can only be rendered as a Component or passed to props of a Client Component.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>The error message indicates a common issue in Next.js applications when using React hooks in a server component. The error specifically mentions `useUser()` from Clerk, which is a client-side hook being used in what appears to be a server component.

In Next.js 13+ with the app router, components are server components by default. Client-side hooks like `useUser()` can only be used in client components, which need to be explicitly marked with the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file.

Looking at the attached file (src/app/page.tsx), I can see that:

1. The component is importing `useUser` from Clerk
2. It's using this hook to get the user information
3. It's not marked as a client component with `'use client'` directive
4. There's also a linter error showing that `isSignedIn` isn't exported from Clerk - it seems the code is declaring a local variable with that name based on the user object

To fix this, I need to:

1. Add the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file
2. Fix the import issue with `isSignedIn` (since it's not an exported member from Clerk)
3. Fix the button type issue in the SignOutButton component

Let me implement these fixes.</think>Looking at your code, the error is occurring because you're trying to use Clerk's client-side hooks (`useUser`) in a server component. In Next.js with the App Router, components are server components by default.

I'll fix this by adding the 'use client' directive and fixing the associated issues:

---

```diff
+ 'use client';
+ 
  import Image from "next/image";
  import Link from "next/link";
- import { SignInButton, SignOutButton, isSignedIn, useAuth, useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";
+ import { SignInButton, SignOutButton, useAuth, useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";
  import { isAdmin } from "@/lib/auth";
  
```

```diff
  							)}
  							<SignOutButton>
- 								<button className="rounded-full border border-solid border-transparent transition-colors flex items-center justify-center bg-foreground text-background hover:bg-[#383838] dark:hover:bg-[#ccc] text-sm h-10 px-4">
+ 								<button type="button" className="rounded-full border border-solid border-transparent transition-colors flex items-center justify-center bg-foreground text-background hover:bg-[#383838] dark:hover:bg-[#ccc] text-sm h-10 px-4">
  									Sign Out
  								</button>
```

The error has been fixed with three changes:

1. Added `'use client'` directive at the top of the file. This is crucial because Clerk's hooks like `useUser()` are client-side hooks that need to be used in client components.

2. Removed `isSignedIn` from the Clerk import since it doesn't exist as an exported member. You're correctly creating your own boolean variable with `const isSignedIn = !!user` later in the code.

3. Added the required `type="button"` attribute to the button element inside the SignOutButton component to satisfy accessibility requirements.

The error occurred because in Next.js with the App Router (which you're using), all components are server components by default. Server components can't use client-side hooks or browser APIs. By adding `'use client'`, you're explicitly marking this component as a client component, allowing it to use client-side hooks like `useUser()`.

How do you seed data using Drizzle and SupaBase? 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is asking about seeding data using Drizzle ORM with Supabase, which is a valid question based on the project requirements document I saw earlier. Let me provide a comprehensive answer on how to set up and implement data seeding with these technologies.

From looking at the PRD context, I know they're using:
- Supabase as the PostgreSQL database provider
- Drizzle ORM for database interactions
- Next.js as the application framework

To explain how to seed data in this context, I'll cover:
1. Setting up a seed script
2. Creating seed data
3. Implementing the seeding logic
4. Running the seed script</think># Seeding Data with Drizzle and Supabase

To set up database seeding with Drizzle ORM and Supabase, you'll need to create a seed script that inserts initial data into your database tables. Here's how to do it:

## 1. Create a Seed Script

First, set up a dedicated seed file in your project:

```tsx
// src/db/seed.ts
import { db } from './db'; // Your Drizzle DB instance
import { restaurants, users, prizes, punchCards } from './schema'; // Your table schemas
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js';
import { migrate } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js/migrator';
import postgres from 'postgres';

async function main() {
  console.log('Seeding database...');
  
  // Clear existing data (optional)
  // await db.delete(restaurants).execute();
  
  // Seed restaurants
  await db.insert(restaurants).values([
    {
      name: 'Pasta Paradise',
      description: 'Authentic Italian pasta dishes made with fresh ingredients.',
      imageUrl: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551183053-bf91a1d81141',
      address: '123 Main St, Foodville, CA'
    },
    {
      name: 'Burger Bliss',
      description: 'Gourmet burgers with unique toppings and homemade sauces.',
      imageUrl: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1568901346375-23c9450c58cd',
      address: '456 Oak Ave, Tasteville, CA'
    },
    // Add more restaurants as needed
  ]).execute();

  // Seed other tables as needed
  console.log('Seed completed successfully');
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    console.error('Seed failed');
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    process.exit(0);
  });
```

## 2. Configure Database Connection

Ensure your DB connection is properly set up:

```tsx
// src/db/db.ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js';
import postgres from 'postgres';
import * as schema from './schema';

// For the seed script, we want a direct connection
// This could be in a separate file from your normal connection
const connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/your-db';

// For one-off scripts like seeding
export const migrationClient = postgres(connectionString, { max: 1 });
export const db = drizzle(migrationClient, { schema });
```

## 3. Add a Script to package.json

Add a script in your package.json to run the seed:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "seed": "ts-node src/db/seed.ts"
  }
}
```

## 4. Create Seed Data for Related Tables

When you have relationships between tables, seed in the correct order:

```tsx
// Example of seeding related tables in order
async function seedRelatedData() {
  // 1. First seed users
  const [user1, user2] = await db.insert(users)
    .values([
      { 
        clerkId: 'user_abc123', 
        name: 'John Doe', 
        isStaff: false, 
        isAdmin: false 
      },
      { 
        clerkId: 'user_xyz789', 
        name: 'Jane Smith', 
        isStaff: true, 
        isAdmin: false 
      }
    ])
    .returning()
    .execute();

  // 2. Then seed restaurants, which don't depend on users
  const [restaurant1] = await db.insert(restaurants)
    .values({
      name: 'Sushi Spot',
      description: 'Authentic Japanese sushi',
      imageUrl: 'https://example.com/sushi.jpg',
      address: '789 Fish St, Ocean City, CA'
    })
    .returning()
    .execute();

  // 3. Then seed punch cards, which depend on users and restaurants
  await db.insert(punchCards)
    .values({
      userId: user1.id,
      restaurantId: restaurant1.id,
      punches: 3,
      completed: false
    })
    .execute();

  // 4. Seed prizes that belong to restaurants
  await db.insert(prizes)
    .values({
      name: 'Free Sushi Roll',
      description: 'Get one free signature roll',
      imageUrl: 'https://example.com/sushi-prize.jpg',
      type: 'food',
      restaurantId: restaurant1.id,
      requiredPunches: 8,
      rules: { expirationDays: 30 }
    })
    .execute();
}
```

## 5. Running with Environment Variables

When running your seed script, you'll need to provide the Supabase credentials:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db.example.supabase.co:5432/postgres npm run seed
```

For more secure environment handling, create a `.env.local` file:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db.example.supabase.co:5432/postgres
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

And update your seed script to use them:

```tsx
// Add to the top of your seed.ts file
import 'dotenv/config'; // You'll need to install dotenv
```

## 6. Handling Production vs Development

You might want different seed data for different environments:

```tsx
// In your seed.ts file
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

async function main() {
  if (isProd) {
    // Maybe just add essential data or nothing at all
    await seedMinimalData();
  } else {
    // Add lots of test data for development
    await seedDevelopmentData();
  }
}
```

This approach ensures you can safely seed your database with appropriate initial data for your Restaurant Passport app.
