Now I need to look at the BentoGrid component implementation to determine how to add a border:

---

Read file: src/components/kokonutui/bento-grid.tsx

---

I've found the bento card component in the codebase. Looking at the implementation, each card in the BentoGrid already has a border, but it's very subtle. The current border is defined in line 72:

```tsx
"border border-gray-100/80 dark:border-white/10 bg-white dark:bg-black",
```

Let's edit the file to make the border more prominent by changing its color and thickness:

---

```diff
  					className={cn(
  						"group relative p-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300",
- 						"border border-gray-100/80 dark:border-white/10 bg-white dark:bg-black",
+ 						"border-2 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 bg-white dark:bg-black",
  						"hover:shadow-[0_2px_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.03)] dark:hover:shadow-[0_2px_12px_rgba(255,255,255,0.03)]",
  						"hover:-translate-y-0.5 will-change-transform",
```

---

I've enhanced the bento card border by:

1. Increasing the border thickness from `border` to `border-2`
2. Making the border color more visible with `border-gray-200` for light mode (instead of the semi-transparent `border-gray-100/80`)
3. Using `border-gray-800` for dark mode (instead of the very subtle `border-white/10`)

These changes will make the border more prominent and visible while still maintaining the design aesthetic of the component.

its not showing up. Is this an issue with @Tailwind CSS v4 ?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The issue is likely related to how Tailwind CSS processes the border classes. Let's try a more explicit approach with stronger specificity:

---

```diff
  					className={cn(
  						"group relative p-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300",
- 						"border-2 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 bg-white dark:bg-black",
+ 						"!border-2 !border-gray-300 dark:!border-gray-700 ring-1 ring-gray-300 dark:ring-gray-700 bg-white dark:bg-black",
  						"hover:shadow-[0_2px_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.03)] dark:hover:shadow-[0_2px_12px_rgba(255,255,255,0.03)]",
  						"hover:-translate-y-0.5 will-change-transform",
```

---

If the border is still not showing after this change, let's try a completely different approach using a direct inline style which will bypass any potential Tailwind issues:

---

```diff
  						},
  					)}
+ 					style={{
+ 						borderWidth: "2px",
+ 						borderStyle: "solid",
+ 						borderColor:
+ 							"var(--tw-border-opacity, 1) * rgba(209, 213, 219, var(--tw-border-opacity))",
+ 					}}
  				>
  					<div
```

---

This should force the border to appear regardless of any potential Tailwind version issues. If you're using Tailwind v4, there might be some differences in how utilities are processed compared to previous versions.

If the border still isn't showing after this change, we should check:

1. Is the component actually re-rendering with the changes?
2. Are you viewing the correct component in the browser?
3. Is there any CSS that might be overriding these styles?

Consider also adding `!important` directly to the inline style for maximum override power:

---

```diff
  					)}
  					style={{
- 						borderWidth: "2px",
- 						borderStyle: "solid",
- 						borderColor:
- 							"var(--tw-border-opacity, 1) * rgba(209, 213, 219, var(--tw-border-opacity))",
+ 						borderWidth: "2px !important",
+ 						borderStyle: "solid !important",
+ 						borderColor: "#d1d5db !important",
  					}}
  				>
```

ok that worked. id prefer to use tailwind classes over style objects. make the border thinner and a bit lighter

---

_**Assistant**_



---

```diff
  					className={cn(
  						"group relative p-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300",
- 						"!border-2 !border-gray-300 dark:!border-gray-700 ring-1 ring-gray-300 dark:ring-gray-700 bg-white dark:bg-black",
+ 						"border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800/40 bg-white dark:bg-black",
  						"hover:shadow-[0_2px_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.03)] dark:hover:shadow-[0_2px_12px_rgba(255,255,255,0.03)]",
  						"hover:-translate-y-0.5 will-change-transform",
```

```diff
  						},
  					)}
- 					style={{
- 						borderWidth: "2px !important",
- 						borderStyle: "solid !important",
- 						borderColor: "#d1d5db !important",
- 					}}
  				>
  					<div
```

---

I've made the following changes to the bento card border:

1. Removed the inline styles completely
2. Changed from `!border-2` (thick border) to `border` (standard 1px border)
3. Lightened the border colors:
   - Light mode: `border-gray-200` (a subtle light gray)
   - Dark mode: `border-gray-800/40` (dark gray with 40% opacity for subtlety)
4. Removed the extra ring utility that was adding a second border effect

These changes should give you a more subtle, thinner border that still provides definition to the cards without being too heavy visually.
