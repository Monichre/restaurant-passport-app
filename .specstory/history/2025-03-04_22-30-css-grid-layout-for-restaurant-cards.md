# CSS Grid Layout for Restaurant Cards (2025-03-04 16:30:23)

Write CSS to make two or three restaurant cards display evenly in a grid

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the CSS to display restaurant cards in an evenly spaced grid with two or three cards per row. Let me check the current implementation first.

---

Read file: src/features/restaurants/RestaurantList.tsx

---

Now I'll check the RestaurantCard component to understand its structure:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "RestaurantCard.tsx" â€¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Read file: src/features/restaurants/RestaurantCard.tsx

---

I'll now update the CSS in the RestaurantsList component to create an evenly spaced grid with two or three cards per row. Here's my implementation:

---

```diff
  			{[...Array(6)].map((_, i) => (
  				<div
- 					key={i}
+ 					key={`skeleton-${i}`}
  					className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-0 overflow-hidden animate-pulse"
  				>
```

```diff
  }
  
- // Restaurant card component
  // Restaurants list component
  export function RestaurantsList({
```

```diff
  			}}
  		>
- 			<div className="flex justify-center items-center align-middle flex-wrap gap-4">
+ 			<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4">
  				{restaurants.map((restaurant: Restaurant) => (
  					<motion.div
```

```diff
  						}}
  						key={restaurant.id.toString()}
- 						className="my-4 mx-auto w-[300px]"
+ 						className="w-full"
  					>
  						<RestaurantCard restaurant={restaurant} />
```

---

I need to fix the linter error about using array index as a key. Let me update the loading component:

---

```diff
  			{[...Array(6)].map((_, i) => (
  				<div
- 					key={`skeleton-${i}`}
+ 					key={`restaurant-skeleton-${i}`}
  					className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-0 overflow-hidden animate-pulse"
  				>
```

---

The linter is still complaining about using the array index as a key, even with a prefix. Let's try a different approach by using a UUID for each skeleton item:

---

```diff
  // Loading component
  export function RestaurantsLoading() {
+ 	// Create an array of unique identifiers for skeleton items
+ 	const skeletonIds = ['sk1', 'sk2', 'sk3', 'sk4', 'sk5', 'sk6'];
+ 	
  	return (
  		<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
- 			{[...Array(6)].map((_, i) => (
+ 			{skeletonIds.map((id) => (
  				<div
- 					key={`restaurant-skeleton-${i}`}
+ 					key={id}
  					className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-0 overflow-hidden animate-pulse"
  				>
```

Great! I've successfully updated the RestaurantsList component to display restaurant cards in a responsive grid layout. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. Changed the container from a flex layout to a grid layout:
   - `grid-cols-1` on mobile (1 card per row)
   - `md:grid-cols-2` on medium screens (2 cards per row)
   - `lg:grid-cols-3` on large screens (3 cards per row)

2. Added proper spacing with `gap-6` (1.5rem) between grid items

3. Added `max-w-7xl` and `mx-auto` to center the grid and prevent it from becoming too wide on large screens

4. Added `px-4` for some horizontal padding on the container

5. Changed the card wrapper from a fixed width (`w-[300px]`) to `w-full` so cards fill their grid cells

6. Fixed the linter error by using predefined unique IDs for skeleton items instead of array indices

These changes ensure that:
- Cards are displayed in a clean, responsive grid
- The layout adapts from 1 to 2 to 3 cards per row as screen size increases
- Cards are evenly spaced and sized
- The grid is properly centered on the page

The restaurant cards will now display evenly in a grid with proper spacing and responsive behavior.
