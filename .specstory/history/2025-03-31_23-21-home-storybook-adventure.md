The Storybook story for the Home component has been created with documentation and responsive variants. The story includes:

1. A detailed description of the Home component and its purpose
2. Four story variants:
   - Default view
   - Mobile view (showing stacked buttons layout)
   - Tablet view (showing intermediate layout)
   - Desktop view (showing full horizontal layout)

I also fixed a typo in the Home component where there was an incorrect character in the next/link import.

The story is set to display in fullscreen layout to properly showcase the responsive design, and includes comprehensive documentation that will appear in the Storybook autodocs.
